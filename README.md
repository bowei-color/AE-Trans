# AE-Trans
`AE-Trans` (AE-Transformer) is a dual-modality fusion interpretable deep neural network model based on the Transformer architecture, capable of integrating RNA and DNA methylation data for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and identifying related biomarkers.The model incorporates an autoencoder, a Transformer model, and the integrated gradients attribution method to compute feature contributions, providing accurate and interpretable predictions for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: The model demonstrated outstanding performance on the test set, with an accuracy of 92.63% and an AUC of 96.76%.
- **Interpretability**: Model interpretation is performed using integrated gradients attribution, allowing the identification of biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease.
- **Dual-modality Fusion**: Leveraging the Transformer to effectively integrate the underlying complementary information between RNA and DNA methylation data, generating better latent representations of both RNA and DNA methylation data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using the AE to effectively reduce data dimensionality and extract important information from the features.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python >= 3.9.x
- PyTorch == 2.5.0 
- NumPy == 1.24.3
- Pandas == 2.2.3
- Scikit-learn == 1.5.1

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch numpy scikit-learn
```

or use the following command to install all dependenciesï¼š

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Installation

To use the `AE-Trans` model, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bowei-color/AE-Trans.git
```

Create a virtual environment using conda:

```bash
conda create --name environment_for_aetrans python=3.9
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
conda activate environment_for_aetrans
```

Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd AE-Trans/model
```

### Usage

To run the model with the provided dataset, execute the following command:

```python
python AE-Trans.py --epochs[number of iterations] --file_path_gene[your gene data file path] --file_path_methy[your methylation data file path]
```

## Input structure

AE-Trans implements a binary classification task, where the input includes RNA data and DNA methylation data. In both the RNA and DNA methylation data, the first column contains the sample names, the second column contains the labels, and the features start from the third column onwards.

### Example for data:

```bash
  Sample      Label Feature1  Feature2   Feature3 ...
GSM2139163      1    0.235     1.378      3.546
GSM2139164      0    10.731    0.556      6.034
GSM2139165      0    3.265     2.931      2.878
GSM2139166      1    5.307     4.251      11.215
```
