# AE-Trans
`AE-Trans` (AE-Transformer) is a dual-modality fusion interpretable deep neural network model based on the Transformer architecture, capable of integrating RNA and DNA methylation data for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and identifying related biomarkers.The model incorporates an autoencoder, a Transformer model, and the integrated gradients attribution method to compute feature contributions, providing accurate and interpretable predictions for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieves outstanding performance with an accuracy of 92.63% on the test set.
- **Interpretability**: Model interpretation is performed using integrated gradients attribution, allowing the identification of biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease.
- **Dual-modality Fusion**: Leveraging the Transformer to effectively integrate the underlying complementary information between RNA and DNA methylation data, generating better latent representations of both RNA and DNA methylation data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using the AE to effectively reduce data dimensionality and extract important information from the features.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python >= 3.9.x
- PyTorch == 2.5.0 
- NumPy == 1.24.3
- Pandas == 2.2.3
- Scikit-learn == 1.5.1

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch numpy scikit-learn
```

or use the following command to install all dependenciesï¼š

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Installation

To use the `AE-Trans` model, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bowei-color/AE-Trans.git
```

Create a virtual environment using conda:

```bash
conda create --name environment_for_aetrans python=3.9
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
conda activate environment_for_aetrans
```

Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd AE-Trans/model
```

### Usage

To run the model with the provided dataset, execute the following command:

```python
python X-scPAE.py --epochs[number of iterations] --file_path[your data file path]
```

## Input structure

X-scPAE implements a multi-class classification task, with inputs including labels and features, where the first column consists of labels in numerical form, and the same number indicates the same category.

### Example for data:

```bash
Label Feature1  Feature2   Feature3 ...
  1    0.235     1.378      3.546
  2    10.731    0.556      6.034
  5    3.265     2.931      2.878
  8    5.307     4.251      11.215
```
